# py_steam_net

Python bindings for Steamworks networking lobbies and messages. This library enables interaction with Steam lobbies and messaging from Python applications, utilizing Rust via [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/) and the [steamworks-rs](https://docs.rs/steamworks/latest/steamworks/) crate, and built with [Maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/).

## üåü Features

* **Steam Client Management**: Initialize and deinitialize the Steam client.

* **Lobby Functionality**:

    * Create various lobby types (Private, Friends Only, Public, Invisible).

    * Join existing lobbies by ID.

    * Leave active lobbies.

    * Retrieve lobby member lists.

* **Messaging System**:

    * Send messages to Steam users within a connected lobby.

    * Receive incoming messages via a callback mechanism.

* **Real-time Callbacks**:

    * **Lobby Changes**: Notifications for lobby state updates (e.g., member joins/leaves).

    * **Message Reception**: Callback for incoming messages, providing sender's Steam ID and content.

    * **Connection Failures**: Callback for network connection issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Rust Toolchain**: Install Rust using `rustup`.

* **Python 3.8+**: Compatible Python version required.

* **Steamworks SDK**: `steam_api64.dll` (or equivalent for OS) required in application's executable directory or Python path for the example application.

### Installation

`py_steam_net` is not yet available on PyPI. However, pre-built wheels for various platforms are available in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/your-username/py_steam_net/releases) section of the repository. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system and install it using pip:

```bash
pip install py_steam_net-x.y.z-cpXX-cpXX-your_platform.whl
````

### Building from Source

Requires `maturin`:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/py_steam_net.git](https://github.com/your-username/py_steam_net.git) # Replace with actual repo URL
cd py_steam_net

# Install maturin
pip install maturin

# Build and install in development mode
maturin develop --release
```

This compiles the Rust code and installs the Python package.

## üöÄ Usage

`PySteamClient` exposes core functionality. A simplified example for client initialization and lobby creation:

```python
import py_steam_net
import ctypes
import os
import sys

# IMPORTANT: Ensure steam_api64.dll (or equivalent for your OS) is accessible.
# For bundled applications (e.g., with PyInstaller), you might need to
# include it with the application.
def load_steam_api_dll():
    if hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS'):
        dll_path = os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, "steam_api64.dll")
    else:
        dll_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "steam_api64.dll")
    try:
        ctypes.WinDLL(dll_path) # Just load it, no need to assign to a variable if not used directly
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error loading steam_api64.dll: {e}. Ensure it's in the correct directory.")
        sys.exit(1)

load_steam_api_dll()

def on_lobby_created(lobby_id, error=None):
    if error:
        print(f"Failed to create lobby: {error}")
    else:
        print(f"Lobby created with ID: {lobby_id}")

# Create a Steam client instance
client = py_steam_net.PySteamClient()

# Initialize the client with your App ID (e.g., 480 for Spacewar)
try:
    client.init(480)
    print(f"Steam client initialized: {client.is_ready()}")

    # Create a public lobby with a max of 4 members
    client.create_lobby(2, 4, on_lobby_created)

    # In a real application, you would run callbacks and receive messages in a loop
    # import time
    # for _ in range(100): # Run callbacks for a short period to allow lobby creation to complete
    #     client.run_callbacks()
    #     time.sleep(0.016)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Always deinitialize the client when done
    if client.is_ready():
        client.deinit()
        print("Steam client deinitialized.")
```

For a comprehensive example, refer to `example/test.py`.

### Callback Signatures

  * `set_lobby_changed_callback(callback_fn)`:

      * `callback_fn(lobby_id: int, user_changed: int, making_change: int, member_state_change: int)`

  * `set_message_recv_callback(callback_fn)`:

      * `callback_fn(sender_steam_id: int, msg_bytes: bytes)`

  * `set_connection_failed_callback(callback_fn)`:

      * `callback_fn(steam_id: int, reason: str)`

### Available Methods

  * `PySteamClient()`: Constructor.

  * `init(app_id: int)`: Initializes client.

  * `deinit()`: Deinitializes client.

  * `is_ready() -> bool`: Returns `True` if client is initialized.

  * `run_callbacks()`: Runs pending Steam API callbacks.

  * `receive_messages(channel: int, max_messages: int)`: Receives messages on a channel.

  * `create_lobby(lobby_type: int, max_members: int, callback_fn: Callable[[int, str | None], None])`: Creates a lobby. `lobby_type`: `0` (Private), `1` (FriendsOnly), `2` (Public), `3` (Invisible).

  * `join_lobby(lobby_id: int, callback_fn: Callable[[int, str | None], None])`: Joins a lobby.

  * `leave_lobby(lobby_id: int)`: Leaves a lobby.

  * `get_lobby_members(lobby_id: int) -> list[int]`: Returns Steam IDs of lobby members.

  * `send_message_to(steam_id: int, message_type: int, channel: int, message: bytes)`: Sends byte message to a Steam ID. `message_type` corresponds to `steamworks::networking_types::SendFlags` (e.g., `2` for `RELIABLE`).

  * `own_steam_id() -> int`: Returns current user's Steam ID.
